/**
 * The terminal workspace — split, resize, sweep, and open new shells.
 *
 * Arrangement lives in `lib/tiles` (a tree, pure) and what a pane SHOWS lives in
 * `lib/panes` (a binding, pure). This file turns those into boxes, and turns
 * pointers back into rewrites. It decides nothing about layout.
 *
 * FIVE THINGS ARE NOT OBVIOUS, AND ALL FIVE WERE LEARNED THE HARD WAY.
 *
 * 1. THE PANES ARE A FLAT LIST IN A FIXED ORDER. Nesting them the way the tree
 *    nests remounts every <iframe> on any split, and each terminal reconnects.
 *    The order comes from `stableOrder` — append-only — because it once came from
 *    the sessions array, which the control plane sorts by RECENCY: a session
 *    touching its cwd could reorder the array and remount the whole page.
 *
 * 2. A DRAG NEEDS A SHEET. The pointer leaves the divider and immediately crosses
 *    an iframe, which swallows the event; the drag dies a few pixels in. A
 *    transparent overlay for the duration keeps the events on this document.
 *
 * 3. A TERMINAL PROVES ITSELF; IT IS NOT INFERRED. The rescue must be ON TOP of
 *    the frame — measured at eight viewports, `elementFromPoint` returned the
 *    iframe every time, so a way out underneath is no way out. And WHETHER to
 *    show it comes from the terminal saying `hanzo-term: ready`, never from
 *    reading the frame's DOM: a gate redirect ending at hanzo.id's
 *    `frame-ancestors 'none'` leaves `chrome-error://chromewebdata/`, which
 *    throws on contentDocument exactly like a healthy cross-origin load. Silence
 *    is the rescue; every way a frame can fail is the same silence.
 *
 * 4. A PHONE PAGES, IT DOES NOT TILE. 390px cannot hold two terminals and stay
 *    legible, so `pageGeometry` turns side-by-side splits into swipeable pages
 *    and keeps stacked ones stacked. Same tree, same renderer.
 *
 * 5. THE NARROW LAYOUT IS ONE MEASUREMENT, NOT A MEDIA QUERY. `paging` already
 *    asks the only question worth asking — can this box hold two terminals —
 *    and the chrome that used to answer it separately, at a viewport width,
 *    now reads the same value. gui emits nothing at all for a breakpoint prop
 *    without its optimizing compiler — measured, `$gtXs={{backgroundColor:
 *    'red'}}` painted no red at 1440 and put no class on the element — so a
 *    second breakpoint written that way would have been silently absent
 *    rather than merely redundant.
