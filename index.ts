/**
 * The workspace, for whoever is hosting it.
 *
 * tabs.hanzo.ai is one host. The desktop shell is another, and hanzo.ai a
 * third — the same tiling of terminals, desktops and pages in each, because it
 * is the same component rather than three that look alike. That is the whole
 * reason this file exists: a second copy of a pane tree is a second set of
 * answers to what a split does, and they drift.
 *
 * WHAT A HOST SUPPLIES is the machines and a way to mint a pane's url. The
 * `Workspace` component holds no token and calls no server: `hosts` and `mint`
 * come in as props, so a host points them at whichever control plane its
 * identity belongs to. The functions in `lib/api` are the ones tabs.hanzo.ai
 * uses for that, offered here because another host most likely wants the same
 * ones — each taking its origin as a parameter.
 *
 * SOURCE IS PUBLISHED, not a build. Both hosts compile TypeScript already, so a
 * build step here would be a second toolchain producing something neither
 * needs, and one more thing to be stale.
 */

/**
 * The wiring, so a host supplies a token and nothing else.

 * `useFleet` reads the registry, folds sessions and sandboxes into machines,
 * mints a url per pane and polls on the plane's own clock. It was the web app's
 * page; copied into each host it would be three answers to how often a machine
 * goes stale.
