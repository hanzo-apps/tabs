/**
 * What the plan allows: how many tabs may stream at once.
 *
 * The cloud decides it — Free streams none, Pro two, Max more — and this module
 * only asks. The answer is one integer, `tabs` on `GET /v1/entitlements`: 0 for
 * none, N for a cap, -1 for no cap. A plane that does not say (an older cloud, a
 * read that failed) answers `null`, and `null` is NOT a limit: the workspace
 * enforces only what it was told, so a cloud that has not shipped the key never
 * turns paying users away.
 *
 * A tab is STREAMED when a pane holds a live shell or screen. A page, an empty
 * pane, a machine that is starting or gone holds no stream and counts for nothing.
