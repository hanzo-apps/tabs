/**
 * The machines you have, ready to hand to a workspace.
 *
 * This is the wiring between a control plane and the `Workspace` component, and
 * it lived in the web app's page — which was fine while there was one host.
 * There are three now (tabs.hanzo.ai, the desktop shell, hanzo.ai), and the
 * wiring is the same React in each: read the registry, fold sessions and
 * sandboxes into machines, mint a url per pane, poll on the plane's own clock.
 * Copied three times it would be three sets of answers to how often a machine
 * goes stale.
 *
 * WHAT A HOST STILL OWNS is the token and where its cloud is. Everything else
 * is here. The token is passed in rather than fetched because each host gets it
 * its own way — a browser mints it with PKCE, the desktop already holds the
 * signed-in user's — and this module has no business knowing which.
