/**
 * A terminal layout, as a value.
 *
 * A tiled workspace is a TREE, not a list of rectangles. The list is the shape
 * that looks easier — every pane carries x/y/width/height — and then it cannot
 * answer the one question that matters: close a pane, and who gets the space?
 * With boxes you are left recomputing every neighbour and hoping the arithmetic
 * closes. With a tree the answer is structural and exact: a pane's space belongs
 * to its sibling, so closing it replaces the parent split WITH that sibling and
 * nothing else moves.
 *
 * That is the whole reason for this file. Every operation here is a pure rewrite
 * of one tree into another, so the interesting behaviour — split, close, resize,
 * the order you sweep through panes in — is decided and tested without a browser,
 * a layout engine, or a single pixel.
 *
 * `row` puts children side by side (the divider is vertical, it moves left/right).
 * `col` stacks them (the divider is horizontal, it moves up/down). Those are the
 * CSS flex-direction words, chosen so the renderer passes the value straight
 * through rather than translating a private vocabulary into the platform's.

// Nested flex boxes are the obvious rendering, and they reload every terminal
// the moment you split one: a pane that changes position in the React tree is a
// new element, so its <iframe> is torn down and its shell reconnects from
// scratch. A multiplexer whose panes reset when you rearrange them is not a
// multiplexer. So the panes render as ONE flat list that never reorders, each
// positioned absolutely from the numbers below — the DOM order stays fixed, the
// iframes stay mounted, and only their coordinates change.
